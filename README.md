# NAS-at-home

**HIGHLY**
 inspired by [TheWaWaR](https://github.com/TheWaWaR)'s version of the software [simple-http-server](https://github.com/TheWaWaR/simple-http-server). Please make sure to take a look at his work before looking more into this.

My goal is to build something similar without taking a look at his code (I can look at the html my browser receives). Bare in mind this is my first time using http (or https) and/or html + css...
